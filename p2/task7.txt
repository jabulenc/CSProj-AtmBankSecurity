You can get user_id from the Memberlist page and checking the link location- 
it'll say u=# or something to that effect. That was important. Looks like
the user who gets their info set is set by user_id at the end of the
SQL command. I figured this out by pumping in a bad query, which made
the SQL server error out, making the PHP script spit out an error code
despite Alice not being an admin... Anyway, I took this, played around
with it for a while. Setting user_password didn't work correctly. It may
have, if I had maybe been able to get the salt and then crypt up the
password. But in reality, if you had the salt for the crypt, you
could do a lot more damage than just messing with a user!
In the end, I figured that if I could redirect the user_id
to Ted's, then comment out the rest of the query, I could change the
password of Ted's account, only knowing Alices (or whoever's) account.
Changed the email to bed@seed, because you can't set it to an
existing account.

1. Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates independently of a central bank or national fiat curency
2. To generate bitcoins, the Hashcash function as a proof-of-work function, to prove who mined what coins from the block chain.
        Hashcash uses symmetric key cryptography and SHA256
    Hashing is used to both encrypt the input data of the block chain, but to also compress the input data.
    Asymmetric encryption is part of the several safeties built into bitcoin transactions. 
        Transactions are made to addresses, which is essentially saying that the person who owns the private key that corresponds to the transaction address may spend the coin.
